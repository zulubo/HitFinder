This is an extremely niche python script created as a weekend project to create a supercut of a twitch streamer getting hit in Elden Ring. I'm not sure it'll be useful to a single other person on Earth.

This repo includes a command line tool called [TwitchDownloader](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader), which also has a GUI version available, and which I used to download the vods in the first place.

To use the script, install any of its dependent python libraries you don't have, then uncomment out whichever of the last two lines you want to use and run it. FindHits will analyze the videos and detect hits, and ClipHits will download short clips of each one. Very user friendly, I know. It also has a bunch of variables you can configure.
